  	<button class="accordion">What is a hackathon?</button>
  	<div class="panel">
  	  <p>A hackathon is a creativity, learning, and problem-solving marathon where students from different disciplines come together in small teams to work on real projects. The purpose of a hackathon is to have students learn about idea development and product design by being provided resources like hardware, workshops, and mentors. Hackathons are ultimately a collaborative space where creativity is encouraged and a self-confidence can be obtained through hands on learning.</p>
